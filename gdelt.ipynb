    "We observe that for January 15th, 2023, there are 593 finance-related news items, whereas for January 15th, 2019, there are none. This discrepancy arises because the actual news headlines are reliably stored only in the `EXTRASXML` field, which appears to be populated starting around 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GDELT GKG (Global Knowledge Graph) CSV files contain several columns, among which the most relevant for our purposes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GKGRECORDID`: a unique identifier for each GKG record.\n",
    "- `DATE_RAW`: the timestamp of the article.\n",
    "- `URL`: the original URL of the news article.\n",
    "- `THEMES`: tags describing the topics of the article, e.g., `ECON_STOCKMARKET`.\n",
    "- `LOCATIONS`: locations mentioned in the article.\n",
    "- `ORGANIZATIONS_RAW`: recognized organizations mentioned.\n",
    "- `EXTRASXML`: a field containing additional metadata in XML format, including the actual page title.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, we extract the page title from `EXTRASXML` using a function that parses the `<PAGE_TITLE>` tag. This allows us to obtain the news headline in a structured form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def extract_page_title(xml_str: str) -> str:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Extract <PAGE_TITLE> from EXTRASXML field.\"\"\"\n",
    "    if not isinstance(xml_str, str):\n",
    "        return \"\"\n",
    "    match = re.search(r\"<PAGE_TITLE>(.*?)</PAGE_TITLE>\", xml_str)\n",
    "    return match.group(1).strip() if match else \"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is theoretically possible to infer headlines from URLs, since URLs often include the title with dashes replacing spaces, this approach is highly inconsistent and introduces excessive noise, making it unsuitable for reliable data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another significant limitation lies in mapping recognized organizations to financial identifiers such as tickers or PERMCO codes. Each article may contain multiple recognized entities, often including unrelated companies or organizations. Disambiguating which entity corresponds to the relevant financial instrument is both challenging and error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all these reasons, we have decided not to use GDELT as the source for our news dataset."
